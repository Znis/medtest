The Med Test Mobile App simplifies the process of scheduling medical tests. Users can book tests through the app and receive their reports conveniently within the same app. A medical officer collects the required samples from the user at their preferred location. The app also includes account sign-in and signup features for a personalized experience. With this app, users can easily book tests, track their progress, view results, and access their test history. The location feature ensures accurate client information, making it easier and more reliable to locate users when needed.

The application is built using the Flutter framework, utilizing the Dart programming language. It incorporates a location feature powered by the OpenStreetMaps library. Firebase by Google serves as both the backend and database for the app, ensuring seamless functionality and data management.
